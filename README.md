======

Hi! Welcome to Qwiki, a super small, super fast wiki tool. The goal of Qwiki is to provide a no hassle solution for internal Wiki pages.

Clone the repo and run it locally or go to [the test app](http://qwiki.herokuapp.com) and try is out!

#Note on Patches/Pull Requests
======
* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a future version unintentionally.
* Don't update the version number. (If you want to have your own version, that's fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull.)
* Send me a pull request.
